How about group glyphs by type in crafting menu to take less space (e.g. "glyph of X, 4 available"), instead of mentioning each one separately?

I think there should be a trait called 'Truesight' where the unit sees through spying and invisibility. Would be a handy way for some villains to counter those skills till those abilities are reworked.

Kaligath#2905
Idea for structuring the keeper selection into 3 parts.

First is selecting a arch type this effects if the keeper is a fragile spell caster a durable knight a cunning rogue or a devote acolyte.
Second is selecting the race of the keeper this would give perks to relationships as well as natural resistances.
Third is selecting the specialisation this will be classification of the keeper such as perks that would benefit there role better.

Few example
Be a wizard who is of the undead race and is a specialised necromancer this would effectively make him have the characteristics of a lich.
Be a knight who is of the demon race and is a specialised two hand swords this would effectively make them a demon lord.
Be a rogue who is of the elf race and is specialised in archery this would effectively make them an assassin.
Be a acolyte who is of the human race and is specialised in the occult effectively make them a cultist maybe able to summon cthulhu.

The benefit to such a system would be simplified additions to new keeper verity as well as easy mod support as it would be adaptable and even add a deep level of customisability as you would merely be socketing types to form a character..

Hello.Really like this game. I tried the spider queen in version 32 today and I would really like to be able to evolve and eat corpses when playing the spider queen. For example, after eating 10 poisonous flowers, you have the opportunity to follow the branch of poisonous spiders. For different branches of evolution, change the properties of the web, for some, remove it completely, but increase the speed of movement. There are very few games where you can fully play a monster, so I hope to get this opportunity in this game.

i did some tests and figured out that allies won't use items you gave them to fight you once you attack them. They won't equip better gear, they won't use scrolls or throw potions at you. My suggestion is to make other tribes be able to use gear that is on their territory so that if they manage to fight off your attack they're going to use your gear against you

Some counter measure against Peaceful effect. Currently its guaranteed 15 turns to safely attack anybody, it never misses and succubi have infinite uses of it. For example, after Peaceful runs out it can give another trait that makes minion temporarily invulnerable to Peaceful. "Alert" or "Aware of hypnosis"

Probably been suggested already, but ability to add priorities to unit activities would be good. For example, on a goblin artificer, make crafting a strictly higher priority than rituals. That way if there's ever anything to craft, it'll do so. Or for a vampire, make studying a higher priority, so it'll reach it's limit in that before it starts training, if you wish

I was thinking about how you have to un-equip a shield in order to use a bow, then had this thought:
What if instead of a 'shield' slot or 'bow' slot you just merge them into an offhand slot. You could also just let keepers that can use two weapons put the second weapon in the offhand slot.

It would also make room for other offhand items like a magic tome that gives you an ability you can use, or a better torch/lantern that takes up your offhand.

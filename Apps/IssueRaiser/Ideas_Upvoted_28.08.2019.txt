With the idea of Keeper classes here's one for the Beastmaster Keeper: Beastkeepers could make monsters by combining beast minions together. This would give them a way to have more powerful minions in late-game, while only having access to beast minions.

There might be an issue with using your sprites when players haven't yet purchased the full version. It makes no sense to have half sprites half ascii. Also players should want to purchase the full version to support future development. I want the game to be developed until it reaches a natural end, hopefully many years.

In regards to the knight vs. dark night keeper: with the keeper at max training and combat exp of 12 (I believe) it beats the knight at max training and combat exp. Unless the knight is from a late endless raid

Potion (or whatever) of regrowth: A potion that restores a random, single missing/crushed limb (or "limb"). Requirements: Advanced Alchemy (perhaps in combination with advanced sorcery) + legendary laboratory skill + a relatively hefty gold price tag (50? 100?) and/or a relatively rare (read: not stuff you can mine) component (certain mushrooms? Unicorn corpses? Dunno)

Not sure if this has been brought up before but triggers for operating things would be cool.

For example, switches to manually activate traps or say open a gate, possibly pressure plates too that if a creature or enemy creature steps on the plate then triggers whatever is linked to it.

This could also include things like a trap being perpetually on, you could use rooms constantly pumped with poison that would then open releasing the gas.

This would also allow for additional puzzles beyond the sokuban puzzles as well as users could then build their own puzzles within their own dungeons.

Possibly also a “machinery” or “gears” furniture too for creating more compacted complex things for puzzles so it can functionally be setup as an AND or OR gate which then links up to an object it interacts with.

like lets say you've got a longsword and you're attacking middle left, your attack will also hit bottom and top left. Or if you're attacking top left it also hits top middle and middle left boxes too. In case you don't know what I'm talking about, it's the places surrounding your player character/controlled entity.

Make it so the path to your keeper must have at least 1 connection to outside (Other wise people can seal of their dungeon with a wall and it becomes unbeatable, as Righteous Sinner said)

Creature/creature_type specific gear. Would be for stuff like barding for (certain) creatures, claw/fang/hoove bracers/caps, extra large/heavy gear for bigger minions (such as ogres), cursed/unholy/whatever stuff for undead and/or demons, etc.

create a crafting system that uses the old furnace and monster drops to create unique weapons.

For example, a smelted steel ingot will have a damage stat included with it that will transfer to a weapon when crafted. A default "medium" ingot for example could have a +3, +4, or +5 damage stat, with +4 being most common. Creating a sword would thus require two "medium" ingots, a hammer would require "large" ingots +4, +5, +6 and an axe would require "huge" ingots +5, +6, +7. Each weapon would require two ingots, thus you'd get a sword with a minimum value of +6 damage and a maximum value of +10 damage, a hammer with +8 damage minimum and +12 maximum, and axes with +10 min and +14 max. You could also mix in other monster drop items that would simply grant you prefixes like "Wolf Fang Iron Sword" or "Dragon Fang Battle Axe" without changing the sprite. The body sizes of creatures would also tell you what crafting sizes their item drops would be, thus everything would come full circle.

As for armor you could just make the player craft an armor chasis that would only use one ingot, each armor piece could have also have base stat modifiers to keep things inline with the balance that is already present. As for the ingot sizes, a larger ingot could make a more powerful armor piece but that armor piece would be heavier.

@HobbyHorse I really like the idea of thieves trying to sneak in and steal your resources. We’d need some type of stealth mechanic in order for them to sneak in though and not just be a tiny and pointless assault on your base. It would also make traps for detecting sneaky thieves handy too. Perhaps this could be implemented where minions are “Relaxed” and off guard while at base and not being attacked. Then they could have an “Alert” phase if they become aware of an attack or intruders and while being in this phase they receive a moral penalty if you order them to stay in that state which would detect the sneaky enemies. Plus the enemies could be tied to a location, like a bandit hideout where the resources get stored so you can reclaim them.

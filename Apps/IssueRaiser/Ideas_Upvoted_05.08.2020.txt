Differentiate between regeneration and fast healing. Fast healing would work as regeneration currently does; whereas regeneration also allows for (eventual) healing/regeneration of injured/crippled/lost body parts (although ymmv to what extent this is prudent, since you can also give regrow lost body parts as an innate ability).

I have some ideas for status effects for spells and enchanted weapons to inflict.

A) Crying: Damage over time to morale.

B) Demoralized: Unit takes more damage from anything that decreases morale.

C) Apathetic: Unit doesn't gain or lose morale while this lasts, or is just set at 0 morale.

D) Disease: Stat debuff that increase over time until either cured, either by potion or by time passage. Small chance to spread on bump/attack or hauling a diseased corpse.

E) Dizzy: Very short lasting status effect. When moving, this unit moves in a random direction. Ranged and Melee attacks can get scattered to other viable targets.

And I had some traits ideas to apply to monsters.

A) Cold-Blooded: This unit suffers stats debuffs and loses morale over time when in an arctic zone or when frozen.

B) Fearless: Immune to morale damage and panic.

C) Death Explosion: Explode when killed. So I can make exploding skeleton chickens.

D) Trick Shot: This unit can shoot over allied units with ranged a...

My brother have some new ideas he wants added in as well.

1) Lockpicker = This unit moves through locked stuff, similar to disarm traps people moving through traps.

2) Careless = this unit is totally indifferent about friendly fire.

3) Day/Night Bonus = This unit has a stat bonus during the day or night.

4) Retribution/Thorns/Blood Vengeance/etc etc = This unit deals a small amount of damage when it is attacked (if listed as thorns, should be melee only)

5) Lucky = Random things happen to this unit, for good or for worse.

(Oh, boss, I found a gold coin, also, I found monsters in this tile, OH DARK LORD...)

Spell ideas that will challenge Michal hopefully:

1. Overcharge, a spell that sets all spell timers to 0 for 3 turns and allows you to spam abilities, but permanently reduces spell damage by 1 each time it is cast. A counterpart could be a "locked" spell that is unaffected by this ability like a long cooldown ability that increases spell damage by 1.

2. Dualcast, chain two seperate spells together and cast them at the same time. More powerful variations can be Tricast and Quadcast. The main point of this spell is to allow players to experiment with spells and find unique combinations of their own choosing.

3. Ability scrolls - spells that grant other spells

4. AI that actually knows how to use these spells correctly! XD

a kind of monster that has a one-life mission: to dig from a lair in a lower Z level, to the stair that the player has just made... when it is at the stair, it dies or disappears
that feature would make it easier to "find" enemies under Z levels, and make it harder to defend from them aswell
Perhaps this would be a rare feature though... as it would change the game if it is too prevalent

The usual rogue 'Cursed' and 'Blessed' items would be cool. In dungeons and stuff, items have a chance of being cursed, and if equipped, won't get off, and may have a drawback or worse stats. Or may even try to spread the curse to other items. Making or finding stuff that can bless or purify them would be a good early game goal and also help deal with rushing and trying to sneak into high end places to snatch stuff.

Also, having some shopkeepers set up a spell to auto-cursed stolen items would be funny in some cases.

And you can add traits revolving around this, such as lucky units ignoring curses and bad luck units attracting cursed items (picking a cursed item up causes it to replace whatever you're wearing) or to spread the curse even!

I would also like a unique thief ai for some enemies that will use the various stealth and whatnot stuff to try and get into the base and steal certain items of interest, such as equipment, resources, gold, corpses, etc etc, and try to run off the map with it to their base. So lock your shit up tight.

I got a few more ideas.

A) Giant Slayer Trait- This unit has a bonus against bigger units.
Midget Masher Trait- This unit has a bonus against smaller units.

B) Economical Items: Items that only workers equip for a boost in a certain skills. Pickaxes for better digging. Crafting hammers for better forge. Etc etc.

C) Beast-Only Items: Basically something like a collar to slap on war beasties for some minor boost or magical effect. Could also be useful for taming beasts in some sort of capture and tame war beasts idea later down the line.

1% min damage even when def is too high.
On one side, its entirely in roguelike spirit to have an indestructible enemy on your tail and planning your dungeon with loops to escape this situation as well as putting fire traps, using rings of magic damage and poison to deal with it. Watching your legion of 30-35 atk units getting wrecked is a part of it too, it adds to experience.
On the other hand, it makes melee units who cant penetrate high def nothing more than a cannon fodder, and you have a lot of those for the most part.

Make Morale swings make minions do random things, like throwing themselves in the river after being depressed for awhile, or gaining a random stat point after being happy all the time.

Other things that could happen would be:
- Gaining a trait (good or bad)
- degrading or improving gear
- starting fights
- murdering a prisoner
- wasting consumables
- crafting something random
- digging holes in walls
- generally being random while they aren't doing something

I personally think that the morale system could use a good bit of randomness and flavor so no minion is the same as another. And who wouldn't love an insane minion eating a gold statue and crapping out a Golden Scepter of stomach acid 🙂

Adding onto previous suggestions for the Morale system, each minion could have their own decreased morale effect, so it isnt entirely random and each one is unique.
IE normal unhappiness effects still apply, some minions may have the effect of refusing to work/train/follow orders, some may leave, some more unstable ones might go insane.

It would also be nice to have some luxury requirement for some (and maybe a likes/dislikes). So beasts and lesser minions will have no issue living in a crumby cave, but higher leveled and smarter ones might expect some class for their service. At the moment there's not much reason not to max out your dungeon population with whatever comes your way.

i imagine minions having quests of their own, but not necessarily traveling ones. Maybe orc fighter desires to become a mage and keeps poking around in the library which eventually leads to him spawning a unit that is stronger than him and if you help him out he'll become a magic user as well as a fighter

This has probably been suggested, but I think having creatures that can be promoted would be interesting.
Say a fighter defeates 10 creatures and becomes a warrior.
So mechanically a 'upgrade' like spells have for creatures based on x creatures defeated.

To build on this, you could also do what The Battle for Wesnoth does, where you can select which creature they become.
So with the fighter example, having defeated 10 creatures they can become a warrior or archer.
You wouldn't need much new GUI for this either. A creature could be highlighted somehow when eligible, and the promotion 'screen' could be a small window with icons for each option.

Make each minion claim a bed and use only that bed to sleep.

For gameplay reasons: Right now you can make 2-4 luxury beds that your whole dungeon population uses and put 50 simple beds in a dirt room downstairs, which will never be used. It kinda makes the luxury system obsolete. Same goes for training / study rooms, but that´s another subject.

For astetic reasons: Make the bed sheets hide the body of the minion when sleeping 🙂 Minions could even personalize their bed, like back in the dungeon keeper times. Mages put a book on the pillow, orcs an axe, etc.

<@!437168150837067779> Said this: I remember a useful piece of knowledge from D&D game designers. They said any change that makes battles more random eventually works against the player bc any mob would probably be in the fight with player once and die in it while its the player who ends up having hundreds of battles and suffering through its randomness
I guess it could be reversed for being invulnerable. If roguelike element implies that high lvl minions are invulnerable against low lvls over time its the player who ends up being invulnerable
I think instead of hp some sort of fatique could be added that serves as a percent modifier of your stats
Fighting expends fatique, at 50% fatique you have 50% of your base stats
Tbh, D&D 3.5 addreses mismatches in battle quite well, good source of ideas.
There s heat metal, concealment, sunder, pin and coup de grace, hold person
Many tactics to take out high stats units

"Retaliation" damage/effects. For effects, this would be like on hit effects, except the on-hit refers to the item/creature that is hit instead of what hits/is used to hit.

Could potentially have multiple versions (such as ranged or melee only instead of it being either both or not at all).

minion's kill count as an immigration requirement for other type of minion. For example, a wolf with 10+ kills is a requirement for alpha wolf to show up in roster.
This way, game would offer you minions that most suit your style and makes tougher minions harder to get bc you have to fight to even have a chance of getting them

I think a necromancer trying to become a lich would be fun too
you get undead special to him and have to research and preform rituals on you path to lichdom
also I think necromancy would just be a really cool spell list
Some spell suggestions:
Raise dead(Raise dead advanced/Raise dead mastery): You can raise a corpse 2/4/6 tiles away into an undead (Corpses become zombies, bones become skeletons) May be temporary summon.
Life drain: Magic missile that returns damage done as health
Slow: Puts slowness on target
Mass raise dead: An aoe raise dead spell
Summon Skeletons: Summons 3 Skeletons
Summon Zombie: Summons 5 Zombies
Unlife: Become undead for a while
Heal undead: Restores undeads limps
Special Undead Ideas
Zombie Giants: Something like a cyclopes zombie that is big, mean, and hard to take down.
Ghouls: Plague spreading clawed and fast undead
Rejuvenate: A fast high train capability skeleton
Necromancer Apprentice: Lesser versions of the keeper
Necromantic Experiment: A abomi...

Suggestion : Adding the option to change a team when in Control Mode : full.

Reason : If we are stuck controlling a blind leader, we can't see the others , unless going Control Mode : full , which doesn't have the option .
A blind leader can be a skeleton that got his head chopped off

Not sure whether to put this in ideas or bug reports. When a minion is using a training dummy and there's more than one available, they tend to waste a lot of time moving back and forth between dummies. My suggestion is to make it so that minions pick a (currently unused) dummy, then keep using it until some other need interrupts that.

idea: a minimum competency slider option under each type of crafting station. i.e. you click on the workshop and it has a slider in increments of 10%. A minion's skill at that workshop must meet or exceed your setting in order for it to begin using that workshop.

Tying it to the minion's skill will make it more mod-friendly, since all the modder has to do is set the minion's skill without needing to add anything else.

This has probably been suggested before, but here it goes yet again. Add a way to lock consumable items to minions, both quantity and type of consumables they carry. Right now its really messy managing potions between minions and they often drop the potions you just had them pick up for no good reason. E.g, if I lock 10 potions of healing to an Ogre, it will try to have 10x at all times, if the quantity set is not available it will pick up as many as possible. Also minions with locked consumables would take precedence over other minions when picking up their items.

1: Scythe trap Deals modest damage and removes one limb. Can remove head. I see it as being expensive but a gamble against strong enemies
2: caltrops A trap that lasts for 5 turns and slows intruders.
3: Barrier trap This trap is either going to be either a joke or overpowered to be honest. When set off it either instantaneously creates a barricade in the space behind the square. I'd prefer a soft rock pillar, but I don't how long it would take some enemies to get through.

I'm not a modder, but for those who are I have eight ideas that could add something to the game. First of all Five animals
1: Spider This little guy will die easily. He's not a combatant even though he has a modest poisonous bite. His main draw is to have two webs active at one time. The cooldown of his webs would be that so he could have two out at the same time for five turns or so. They wouldn't be permanent by any means, but they'd add some tactical decisions.
2: Snake again not very durable, but his poison does moderate damage over a long time. Maybe enough to take down a bandit or really hurt a dwarf, but not enough to take down mid to late enemies.
3 and 4: Tiger and cheetah. The tiger is an ambusher while the cheetah is speedy. Each of them do a percentage amount of damage. I'm thinking 10 or so.
5: plague rats: weak, fast, die to a sneeze. However they do a moderate poison that spreads to nearby units.

Since you were talking about expansions and outposts from the original starting map. Heres something Ive been interested in for some time now. Give minions the ability to organize parties on their own and raid other territories, similar to how beasts can explore on their own, but on areas other than the starting one. I leave the details to Michal, but basically when your minions feel confident/motivated enough they would from parties on their own, travel to enemy territory and attack them, this of course would be an activity you would be able to turn on or off, just like any other. When one of these parties is out raiding youd be able to change the focus to where they are and watch their raid develop and if necessary take manual control of the units. This would give more personality to the AI and would also be a refreshment from late game aimlessly walking around the dungeon state that all minions end up in after a certain time.

make the new teams added on top of the list of current teams. either that, or a way o change team lis order manually by clicking a team and moving it through the list. EDIT: would make creating new teams much easier, as well as editing old ones, as you wouldn't have to scroll all the way down and back up every time yo want to edit. also, if you have too many teams due to population groups, like with goblins, you still cant add a whole category to a team that isn't veiwable from where you click on the category. if its further down the list than hat, you're screwed

Probably already been suggested: please show the number of (craftable) armor/weapons/etc in some easily accessible way. Currently, to check how many weapons or armor items you already have in stock you need to go through the eqipment menu for a minion. Why not show it in brackets behind the item's name in the crafting menu of workshops/forges/jewelleries? This would make it much easier to get a rough estimate what you need to craft next.

Another Ideas:

1. RG events, wandering merchant from ally ,anything I can trade my unusable items with.

Distressed adventurers who needing help, if they are helped a chance to convert them if not they stab you in the back by killing your minions and taking the gold

2. Pls make tribe leader not attacking the dungeon. They should stay in their base for more immigrants. If not killed they will send attack with double the numbers and stronger units. But with 2x more time between each attacks.

add a way to unclaim tiles. holding ctrl doesn't work. sometimes you dig out a tunnel only to get at ores and you don't want your minions actually going there unless they have to for a fight, so you can't really lock a door or add forbidden zones there or else they won't be able to go there period

I would like more dialogues support. It would be very very nice.

1. Atm the chat history is very cluttered and it doesn't save dialogues you get in character control mode. Please make the dialogue saved in the history

2. Allow the game to visualize a dialogue box when it's necessary, e.g when offering multiple choices. That is when the chat is used or when an item is used.

3. Multiple choices in dialogue box, that triggers an effect. E.g writes flag or removes flag. Etc.

Unlock Adventurer Characters after finishing game and completing certain trigger. Requirements:
- the game need to save an universal flag outside of save games. The flag also requires it's mod id to be active.
- character selection that reads the flag.

How will this complicate the code? I don't think this will complicate the code if the requirements are fulfilled.

Add an ability or workbench that allows you to change a minion or prisoner into something else with an optional resource input.
For example, if you had an item like..."draconic essence" you could combine it with any of a group of units (humanoids for example) and it would create a dragonkin, consuming the unit and the item.
Or something like a 'polymorph' ability with a configurable output, for use in modding

Why don't add a few multi-tiled monsters? We can start by making, instead of the actual dragons come to attack you, making them been just babys, because the actual dragon is hidden, idk in a cave with other baby dragons, protecting a lot of gold. It will be a 2x2 or 3x3 dragon, that will also be useful as a main villain

Units should not automatically equip items with attributes that already have or are useless for them.
For example, vampires do not need night vision amulets, because they already have this attribute, but they still equip these amulets. Units that cannot craft, like bandits, should not automatically equip a ring of fast crafting.

agreed, every mod should add prefixes or suffixes to their entries to avoid conflicts. discussed this before when we first got access to a30 unstable, but now that a30's actually out in the wild it seems pretty important

I feel that could be solved with a rework of the Zone system. Just allow multiple zones to be put down and allow them to be labeled and specified. (I mentioned it in the Talk to Michal channel)

"I would suggest changing the zone system for guard areas. Making it so you can make a zone and then select what it is. That way the player can have more than 3 quarters designated, and different guard areas. This would eventually allow for different groups to be assigned to different guard areas"

It would be cool for adventurers to be able to buy or otherwise unlock certain traits and skills like Flying, Dual wielding, Can see in the dark, Telepathy, Swimming, etc. Perhaps they could come as special items at the bottom of keeper dungeons/dragon castles, as rewards for quests, or in return for paying a skill trainer or something. If they were items normal keepers could use them, too. But if it was something unique to adventurers, it would spruce things up a bit for that game mode. Atleast something like Dual weild (since you can't get that through an item). In the future a skill tree would be mouth-watering.

most undead should have much higher def bc of how little pain and blood loss concerns them, and it would help them not lose their limbs as often. Its also thematically appropriate as in beasts are high atk low def, humanoids are in the middle and undead are low atk high def

Imp like creatures for non evils. Specifically, the infinite carry capacity that imps have. Like, a automaton that has shelving or something akin to that. Or maybe something like an equipable cart, takes wood to craft, functions as a two handed weapon, and has negative weight and a debuff to combat statistics when equipped. Maybe a potion that doubles carrying capacity at the cost of combat stats, that stacks. So, a potion on a base 800 unit makes 1600, then 3200, then 6400, etc.

Currently, I feel it is a pain to do clearing up after veritable wars and massacres that happen outside the enemy base. My last playthrough of Gnomes led to a massacre of automata around a Hydra, and I have no simple way to recover those limbs and veritable mountains of materials in any timely manner. I feel this could also be solved by a map clear function after every base is wiped out on a map, something that sets every tile as owned by a "new" defeated faction that then allows for 1 click and all items on...

@Michal There is a lot of talk going on in gameplay-help-old , so I'm just going to put down a few Ideas people came up with:
1: Enemies leaning how to kite better.
2: Beast armor.
3: Bears & Wolves breaking moral.
4: Wolves & Bears Pining units to the ground.
5: Give wolves speed.
6: AI knowing how to surround enemies (especially wolves).
7: less defense when there is a wall next to you, and if there are two or three walls around you really cant defend yourself, unless you are a dwarf.
8: big unit's hit could push you back, and if you happen to hit a wall while you are pushed back you take damage.
9: Remove wolves and bears as a corpse farm.

A way to choose which minions are assigned to a guard zone. So that its possible to set up strategic positions for minions vs waves. Orcs in front then mages and archers behind barricades would be possible. i tried using zones and guard zones in tandem with each other but random minions will guard random guard zones even if its not in their assigned zone.
Something like when choosing the guard zone, a menu comes up kind of like the doppelganger absorb menu and lets you select multiple minions for that particular zone. or maybe multiple guard zones with different colors like the quarters zones?

Bulk crafting. in one order produce 10,25,or 50 of an item. useful in late game when you have 80 minions you have to equip to throw at harder main villains or end game when youre getting raided by 3 dragons that rip though all of your defenses and plow through even your strongest minions. having to sit there for 5 min clicking each item 50 times isnt any fun, its just time consuming.

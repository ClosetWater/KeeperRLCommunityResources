Dancing as a status for all allies/enemies etc, having a minion that would start dancing in the middle of battle kind of like how insanity makes u fight everyone, its a bad status effect, but if we could throw disco potions that cause dancing to enemies, wouldnt that be fun too?

Give corpses a tier list, stronger enemy types have a higher tier level than weaker enemies. That way in case someone wants to mod a faction that only raises undead, stronger undead variants can be made using higher tiered corpses.

I was thinking, instead of having the human knight keeper have the two weapons ability, making him feel like the evil knight, you could give him clerical magic and the ability to gain a few more magic levels. That would give him more of a paladin feel and make him more unique.

Maybe dwarves should get a brewery rather than a distillery (unless they're making mushroom vodka or something lol), it's a bit weird having these rock & stone master craftsman making dank rat alcohol

I wonder if it would be unbalanced to have a brewery that requires magic mushrooms or something else to make a mushroom stout, the difference between that and moonshine being that it has no negative effect on your combat ability while also raising morale, maybe it could have some other effect too. To balance it, dwarves morale could take a hit if they don't have it available for awhile

Just a few rough ideas on the topic

I have a few to ask for, terraformers for undead letting you make a fog or haze so you don't have to make an artificial wood canopy just so they can boost gathering productivity, mabye let you make a swamp or terraformed tile till you cover the entire map in dead land swamp or whatever you want to make it, farming trees so you never run out, if terrafroming or mass map fog is doable then mabye a terrafroming faction that does well in snowy terrafromed ground and temporarily change tiles to snow-covered to boost in invading territory

Last idea:
God worship.

Establish some small pantheon of deities, pick one and worship it and you get access to units you wouldn't otherwise, to augment your run a bit.

Adoxie for undead,
Earth deity for golems/earth elementals
Water deity for water elementals/aquatic monsters
Air deity for air monsters/elementals
Fire deity for demons/fire elementals
Law deity for clockwork constructs
Chaos deity for abberations/eldritch monsters
Nature deity for elves/plants/nature-associated creatures
Pestilence deity for rats/bats/snakes/spiders/other insects.
Dragon deity for dragons.
Good deity for angels/clerics.

The idea of automatic looting team is cool too, you select some of your guys and send them to an area you've cleared.
The result on their gathering depends on how much people you send I guess. Could use different factors too. Like looting skill 10% ~ 100% perhaps.

Hi, i really like this game and here are a few things which I think will improve the gameplay.
1)Allow using crafting stations in adventure mode (instead of breaking them)
2) some kind of skill tree for adventure mod (change current character leveling system)
3) rework trading system (I really don't understand how trading works)
//maybe create zones for "goods" and "payment". The player drop the item he wants to buy into the "goods" slot, and then puts money in the "payment" slot. Then uses the command (chat or other) on the merchant. The merchant takes the money and the player can pick up the item without becoming hostile.//
4) More phrases for "chat" (not only "The dwarf says he doesn't like orcs" etc)

an ''endless mode'' for territories instead of endless waves. you would have to do an ''expedition'' by sending out a unit and/or paying a price, this would reveal a new territory for you to visit, once you are done with it you could search for the next territory to loot/plunder. you could even delete the old territory once you search for a new one for memory purposes. this may greatly increase the amount of hours one could put into a savegame.

I have just been in contact with Lord Trillon (a friend of the late modder known as "Righteous Sinner"). It is really good that Game Dungeon is maintaining Bonus Mod for the community. Trillon and I were saying how we like a long tech tree and I am considering a mod that adds a playable faction to allow the keeper to assimilate techs from other factions - to build furniture, craft and gain immigrants by first assimilating a tech that unlocks that faction's technologies. I am asking for any thoughts on how or if this should be done. Upvote if it seems cool.

Pufferfish eating a carrot#0961
If I could be of any help to the issues regarding when the minions should ride steeds, I advise checking the giddy-up mods for rimworld. they have a lot of things that help make gameplay a fair bit better, and one of them is making small dismount points which your colonists can never pass while mounted, and maybe a tool that restricts areas from being available to steeds entirely.

so for example, my goblin rides a wolf to the door of my dungeon, he then dismounts the wolf and, with the wolf being free, it heads to the area with cages where all of my animals sleep, since it doesn't have access to the are the goblin is headed into.

another example is some necromancer riding a bone dragon to the throne room's doors, at which point he dismounts, and heads to the throne/phylactery, and the dragon has a guarding position assigned right next to it, so they both head in the same direction but start doing their own separate tasks at the same location.

i'm pretty sleepy but i can probably imagine more ideas that would give you the general direction mounting mechanics could be headed towards

i think maybe research shouldn’t be based off of how many other factions you kill off, or at least not fully, perhaps combine that system with a tech tree research style system.
Your keeper and some other minions can use libraries or some other object to research certain techcnologies, which tech you can research could be tied to your malevolence level, so at the start you can maybe research sorcery archery and some simple techs, but then the more advanced ones requiring a higher malevolence, and perhaps more specialized stations

Apparently dwarves get the sprite for the promotion that you gave them most recently. This is super confusing, because it makes my melee fighters look like magicians and my ranged ones like melee fighters. I would much prefer it if it took the sprite for whatever type they have the most promotions in. (In case of a tie, give them the sprite of what they got first)

Diggle#1111
going up in zlevels at a mountain side is really cool. i love the idea of building my base on the cliffs of a mountain and such. i think, visually speaking, some improvements could be made. for one, if the upper zlevels are supposed to be cliffs, i think they should be shown as such using cliff edges... i'd also darken the lower levels a bit to indicate they're below you. the mass of arrows indicating a lower zlevel is kinda ugly, but can be kept if you really wanted to.

i've made a quick mockup to show the sort of thing i'm thinking of (actual screenshot vs my idea)

GreatDying_#7831
This probably isnt the first time this is suggested. But give us the option to turn off the warning and auto-pause that occurs any time we are being attacked by a hostile tribe. If i know the attacks arent going to be too problematic id rather not have these auto-pauses and just let my minions deal with the invaders on their own.

Designating certain attack behavior or quarters not just for one creature but for EVERY creature of that type arriving further on would be amazing. Having to manually tell all of my horses not to suicide into some cyclops before they turn into warhorses is a pain in the ass.

A few more leisure activities for minions would be cool, and help the dungeon seem more alive after everyone has finished training. Right now they can wander around and they can dance. What about singing? Or maybe a using a bookshelf just to boost morale? Or sparring sessions? Maybe an arena for non-lethal fights could be immersive.

Minions using potions less liberally.
- Offensive: Don't use unless you see an enemy of equal power or greater power than the strongest member of your team, or double the minion's own stats.
- Healing: Use iff below 50% health
- Regeneration: Use iff damaged
- Plaguee: Don't use (this is like the 5th time I've accidentally given plague to my own dungeon)
- Levitation: Only use if there is no path to the leader without it.
- Telepathy: Use when an ally is blinded (but you are not)

Atm a fox crosses the path en route to a dungeon and he's slowed, asleep, and plague-ridden before a harpy shoots him.

on the topic of hiding information, if you want nethack/rogue play nethack/rogue 🙂
also, stats don't always define how an attack will land, because of RNG
so with the randomness inherent, knowing the stats is at least somewhat kind to the player

I have an old idea for keybinds that is pretty neat: ASDF = Attack, Spell, Defend, Fire
it might not make it to the game, but it's still pretty
since ranged weapons and spells are part of this game, it would make sense to use those
but defend would have to be something else
just ASF would work fine there, or even just SF for Spell and Fire
I have many ideas for the keybinds, but I guess they don't matter that much in the end

Ants and some other raiding party people are able to break and build things on other maps, which is annoying, can there be a thing that allows you to make it so they can't dig or bridge? And what about allowing your side to dig, or you being able to while possessing, being able to dig, that would allow you to harvest materials and get to places the enemy that you defeated was yet to open or dig, so for you to dry the map of resources you can just either order units with the ability to dig to carve it out so you can pick em up and bring em back

I just had a simple idea of, pretty much, phrases your keeper can scream out when engaging in combat. Somewhat like that one popup you get if you try to steal from a dragon with invisibility. Maybe make it something optional you can fill-in for it to come up when another player raiding your dungeon decides to initiate the final fight with a keeper.

Replying to Lord_Kazzak#6474
Ill made a community hub comment on Steam but as it seems, Discord is way more active so i re post it here and everyone can have his 5 cent on my ideas.

1)Limbs: Should be replaceable, our minions are just undead made of parts.

2)Head shots: The ratio of head shoots seems a little bit over the top. The first attack that came in blinded 5 of my archers with the first arrow shoot at each skeleton and the ratio continues. Maybe find another way to inflict damage than blasting away body parts with ballistas. An idea would be to give each unit an core HP and only loose body parts on critical hits or when the HP fall below a certain threshold.
(If Rimworld had the same ratio, nobody would play it ...)

3)Drowning: Undead minions drown ... which page of the book "undeads don't breath" did i miss here? Making them transparent and extremely slow would made it more realistic.

4)Abusing the undeads literaly everywhere: That one is maybe on me but i very often find my leader deep down in the mines getting on an zombi…

a rating system for retired dungeons would be cool, giving players a prompt to just rate 1-5 stars after they beat the dungeon.

Or the same thing with a categorical rating for loot combat and ambiente/beauty.

Then when adding retired dungeons this rating would be shown next to the conquer rate.

Finally some filtering for retired dungeons would be a great addition too.

i'd like to suggest a slight revamp of the torture system where tortured units lose health instead of dying, and you can heal them back up to continue the torture! maybe blend in some %chance to convert units based on the amount of torture they went trough.

If Michal goes with the 3D graphics (this is hard for me to visualise but sounds really cool). Full possession of a creature could give you a buff to compensate for loss of vision. Perhaps some creatures (such as keepers) could have an avatar trait that enable the buff. Edit: Avatar trait could also add to the number of keepers in your dungeon so you are not finished until you lose all your avatars.

Yes I agree. Cities within a larger kingdom or empire or realm would be an interesting mechanic. So you don't just attack a single elven or dwarven settlement, but if you attack too many you make an enemy of all of dwarven- or elvenkind.

something like potions: Lotions. Can't be thrown or quaffed, but will be applied to another being by hand. Sunscreen is the first use I can think of. That way, you can apply sunscreen to undead beings, which would make them resist the sun and not die in sunlight.

Fighter-type units (vanilla example: knight keepers. Mods add many more) get melee moves as "spells" so from time to time they swap out their sensible helmet for a stylish but impractical cornuthaum.
I'd rather not have to go through every fighter type, check for helmets, and lock them in (especially before getting a good supply of adamantine).

Just started playing, 3 suggestions so far. Guard zone one and the unit selector (full control mode) are really hard to see in the snow biome. I'd suggest a negative or some sort of contrasting change for terrain it's hard to see game selectors on. My 2nd suggestion is a formation mode for controlling units. A lot of the time my units will run into enemies solo when grouped and die really fast because other units too longer to get there and help them. In an open field or cave I wanna be able to keep my units in a line easily. 3rd thing is for group full control, I'd like a way to reorder the units fast. So for example, I could have 3 units in the front in a row and going first so I don't skip over them when trying to cycle turns faster. Or another example is if I split my army in 2, I could order each together instead of having them mixed. ❤️ this game

Hey, everyone, Soft Monster spent some time last month laying out ideas for improving the dungeon-management AI for retired dungeons.
I think most of them (probably "all", but I kinda like getting the enemy resource stockpile intact #greedy ) are good, and upvoted a few items that seemed good & easily-actionable, but I suspect most of the essay kinda got buried before people had a chance to get a good look.
Can I talk you into checking it out?

I remember an old game called Majesty. Where you had your AI "heroes" run around randomly and just do things in the world, and you could influence what they did by placing flags down on things you wanted done, like an explore flag set in the fog where they would just walk to, or an attack flag on a building for them to destroy. You could influence their priority on those flags by putting a bounty of gold on them for whomever to complete. Though in that game each hero had their own money they would spend on upgrades and potions. The heroes also formed parties automatically too in that game.
Though really I think a simple flag system for quick objectives you want to be completed that you could set for AI teams to go do when they feel ready for it would be nice.

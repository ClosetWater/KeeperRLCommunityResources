Superior Steeds

Issue: during A36 and the early aspects of A37, steeds were typically 'squishy', in that mook-tier steeds are notably weaker than their riders,
and high-end steeds could still be either chipped to death or mission-killed with one lucky shot (wing damage against a dragon, for instance).

This mod provides a selection of later-game (tech-gated and level-up, as vanilla white_knight horse>warhorse) mounts for Knight keepers*, available on-demand
at a reasonable cost, so they can be replaced should they get crippled or killed.  Mounts are available for Medium and Large riders. High-end vanilla steeds receive training allotments as well to help forestall lucky shots, and I've tweaked the ki-rin a little.

Ideally, anyone serving a Knight keeper and who needs a mount should be able to obtain one without difficulty.

*Knight keepers feel like they would favor straightforward and predictable paths to victory: breeding horses, war-wolves, etc seems reasonable.
Legendary beasts are more an Evil Wizard sort of thing.  But this is ultimately a modder's belief, and is open to argument.

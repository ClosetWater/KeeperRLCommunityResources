"You set off to establish a new colony. With you are 5 maidens who have sworn an oath of fealty to you. As the chief of your new colony, you will need to create a brood to build and establish yourself in the land. 

You open and read a scroll from your father.

'You have done as instructed and I couldn't be more pleased. I'm sure you want to get to get to know your girls as soon as possible but you have things you need to do first.

You must establish a temporary base of operations outside, and furnish it with basic storage and a workshop. Make a basic set of gear then wait for nightfall. 

Your first night can be done alone, you have two objectives. Destroy the elves and kill as much as you can. Wait for the area to be clear before you gather resources from the destroyed elven nests.

Offer the bones to the great warg matriarch. Once you have room and the food, she will supply as many as you need. These wargs will be invaluable in establishing your main base.

Wax strong, and never trust the Elves.'

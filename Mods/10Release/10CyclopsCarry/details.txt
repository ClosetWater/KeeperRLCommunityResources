"Cyclops Carrying Capacity

When solo-keeping, most players go for the Cyclops.  It's not hard to understand why: you have One Creature,
and if that changes, no achievement.

Trouble is, Keepers with working creatures (Classic Keepers, in 
particular) are NOT disqualified for making use of their workers,
as far as I could tell.  So Evil Wizards and Knights can
dominate the realm while having folks with unlimited carrying
capacity, whereas Cyclopes are forced to do everything
themselves.

This mod issues Cyclops Keepers a potion & a glyph of unlimited
carrying capacity.  While these allow for varying degrees of
inventory-management challenge mitigation, they also remove
lots of early-game tedium.
You decide whether that's a worthwhile goal; I provided both
instant & permanent potion as well as the gear-requiring glyph
so you could calibrate your solution.

Hoping this is useful.

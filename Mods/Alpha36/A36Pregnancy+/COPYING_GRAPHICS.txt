Special case: Modded graphics
------------------------------

Dear reader,

In KeeperRL, modding the software is achieved by making sprites and changing the game configuration.

In some cases with our mods, the tiles have a complicated history with licensing (modified stock graphics or used by permission of Electric Succubi).

DO NOT APPLY ANY GIVEN LICENCE TO THE GRAPHICS FILES IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY EXIST. DO NOT SEPERATE THE GRAPHICS FROM THE MODS OR CHANGE THE GRAPHICS WITHOUT PERMISSION.

Purchase a license for the stock graphics used originally by KeeperRL in the main game from here:

https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/

Mod graphics for KeeperRL may be licensed seperately, but the right to use and modify them can (almost always) be purchased.

The relevant tiles can be downloaded in-game and are not necessarily distributable outside specific conditions but do occasionally form a part of our mods,
which we have the right to publish.

Thanks for your understanding.

Soft Monster

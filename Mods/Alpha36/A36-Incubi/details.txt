Incubi

Women can totally join and lead evil forces, but they have certain wants and needs that may not quite be satisfied by simply enslaving, whipping, torturing, executing, or just simply killing their enemies.  Even soft lighting, beautiful fountains and statuary, fine carpeting, luxurious beds, delicious steaming pigs, and unholy rituals can't really scratch certain itches.

Summon masculine sex demons to sweeten the ladies' dreams too.

Unfortunately, KeeperRL Copulation is hardcoded heterosexual.  Sorry.
Fortunately, Copulators carry any pregnancy, so the incubi will kindly spare their paramours carrying any offspring that may result.

This includes both the vanilla (and totally pretty) non-combat sex demons, as well as BonusMod-inspired (and yummy beefcake) combat-incubi that can train and equip for fights.

Sprites are derived from Pie's work in the Vanilla Retiles mod.  Check it out, if you haven't already!

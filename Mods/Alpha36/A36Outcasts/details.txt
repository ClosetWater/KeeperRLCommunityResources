"Softmonster"
"Choose your own path of technologies, furniture and immigrants. Play a community called "peseants" who are taking outcasts from all the main factions at the same time in one playthrough. This community of misfits have the ability to unite the creatures and technologies of gnomes, goblins, warlocks, undead and knights. They stand as equals and have no leader.

Note: All Softmonster mods are licensed under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (especially for use by Michal if possible).
I just want to improve the game for everyone.
When you derive mods from this code, please keep the licensing file: COPYING in your mod directory.

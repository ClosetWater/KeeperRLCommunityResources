Choose your own path of technologies, furniture and immigrants. Play a community called 'peseants' who are taking outcasts from all the main factions at the same time in one playthrough.

This community of misfits have the ability to unite the creatures and technologies of gnomes, goblins, warlocks, undead and knights. They stand as equals and have no leader but if all the original founders of the faction die, you will lose the game.

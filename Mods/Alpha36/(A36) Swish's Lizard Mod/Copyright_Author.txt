The author of this mod is Swishos from the KeeperRL community.

Entrusted to Softmonster and Shadowing. 

Swishos mentions we can license the config mod code under GPL and simply state that the graphics are not
redistributable, can not be separated from the mod, form a part of the mod and that we have the right to
publish them with the mod.

Letâ€™s make it clear that he is claiming authorship of the mod at the date we upload to GitHub.

GPL should protect him from other people claiming they own it and then relicensing his work under their own terms.

However, he thinks there are only about 10-20 sprites that are modified from oryx compared to the 200-300 odd
that are just customs he made himself.

So most of the art he already owns himself and licensing them as well isn't an issue.

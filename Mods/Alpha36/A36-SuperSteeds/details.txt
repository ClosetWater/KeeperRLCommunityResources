Superior Steeds

Issue: steeds are typically "squishy", in that mook-tier steeds are notably weaker than their riders, and high-end steeds can still be mission-killed
with one lucky shot (wing damage against a dragon, for instance).

Proposed solution: Improved (tech-gated and level-up, as vanilla white_knight horse>warhorse) mook-tier mounts for Knight keepers*, available on-demand
at a reasonably low cost, so they can be replaced should they get crippled or killed.  High-end steeds will get training allotments, and possibly other tweaks
(the ki-rin, for instance, should probably get Escape given that it doesn't feel like a frontline mount).

Ideally, anyone who needs a mount should be able to obtain one without difficulty.

*Knight keepers feel like they would favor straightforward and predictable paths to victory: breeding horses, war-wolves, etc seems reasonable. Legendary beasts
are more an Evil Wizard sort of thing.  But this is ultimately a modder's belief, and is open to argument.

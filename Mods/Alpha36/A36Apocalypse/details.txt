Zombie apocalyse! Most creatures are turning to zombies, who attack during the night.
All player factions get various turrets to help shoot them down.
You need to plan your defences because they are coming for you. Prepare for nightfall!

Hint: Start in a forest to get lots of wooden turrets early on.

Original Description:
Difficulty mod, brand new in A33.

Have you ever thought to yourself, \"Man, that was super easy...\" or thought about making enemies threatening?

Well, have I a deal for you.

This mod here adds not only some new keepers, but more (and harder) endless waves and Z-Levels. No longer will you have to deal with, what, like 10 bandits? Not anymore! (Side note, endless waves should also work for modded keepers but I haven't been able to test it)

This is unforgiving, and using one of the new keepers makes it even harder. The Elven keeper can't trust all immigrants, the ant keeper requires lots of corpses, and the Corrupt keeper is expensive for all the good minions! Not only that, but the minions are worse than usual, making fights much closer and possibly more lethal.

Make sure to check the changelog and intro text!

"Welcome to KeeperRL Alpha 32! This version of A32 Difficulty was released on 6/4/2021.

The changes coming with this update are below.

* Confirmed that I am, in fact, not dead
* Updated the mod to A32 (finally)
* Balance updates and fixes (such as zombie carcass not destroying, hopefully)

As always, any suggestions, bugs, or such can be made known on the workshop page, either in the comments or in a discussion. (You can also @Greenie / @Mark#5291 in the KeeperRL Discord)

"Welcome to Dragon Keeper!  

Lead swarms of Kobolds as a young Dragon founding their first lair!  

Grow in size and capability through experience and the worship of your minions!

A few notes for new players:  I've put a few new mechanics into the base game for Dragons only.

Build some Dragon Shrines for you minions.  The worship your Kobolds provide help you to grow.  It may require some experimentation at the alchemy station using rare gems brought by draconic spirits.

Yes the Black Dragon is blind.  It is also telepathic.  I believe in you."

#Eldrich Flesh
"fleshshaper's favor"              { "Blessed creatures! I have broken through their mortal crust and drawn from them their greatest strength: mutability. I coax bone, weave flesh, and lace sinew tight until it strains to lash out..."}
"worldgrowth's attention"          { "In his home of bone, in his halls of skin, behind his walls of flesh."}
"flesh breeding"                   { "Those who are destined to become food are able to breed in an environment are safe from competition, don't you have the perfect symbiotic relationship with one another?"}

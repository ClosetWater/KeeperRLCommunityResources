Upload to this site if you want the resources you uploaded to be:

1) Used and maintained by the KeeperRL community to improve KeeperRL.
2) Visible to the public
3) Unique to KeeperRL

Otherwise don't.

The copyright belongs to the KeeperRL community and will be managed by a representative of the community.
This person is the owner of this repository in git but the ownership may change hands.

There is nothing hard about this:

1) Leave our resources out of other games - it will make both games less unique and worse
2) Use these resources to improve KeeperRL.
3) Upload useful resources you wish to donate to the community.

Special case: Modded graphics
------------------------------

Dear reader,

In KeeperRL, modding the software is achieved by making sprites and changing the game configuration.
The configuration files are licensed as seen in the COPYING.txt file in each mod folder.
Any graphics will be licensed as seen in the COPYING_GRAPHICS.txt file in each mod folder.

Assume any graphics and tiles I have put into GitHub are a part of mods ARE NOT REDISTRIBUTABLE, because in some cases the tiles have a complicated history with licensing - (modified stock graphics or used by permission of Electric Succubi).

DO NOT APPLY ANY GIVEN LICENCE TO THE GRAPHICS FILES IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY EXIST. DO NOT SEPERATE THE GRAPHICS FROM THE MODS OR CHANGE THE GRAPHICS WITHOUT PERMISSION.

Contact Electric Succubi (Miki@keeperrl.com) for the right to include and modify his graphics tiles in a mod.

I purchased a license for the stock graphics used originally by KeeperRL (in the main game) and this entitles me to use them also in my products, and distribute my free products displaying those graphics. The royalty free license to distribute products that display the older, original graphics can be obtained here:

https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/

So the graphics are not under GPL, although I have a right to use and modify them in my works.
You only have permission to use the relevant graphics by playing the mods in-game, which we have the right to publish.

Thanks for your understanding.

Soft Monster

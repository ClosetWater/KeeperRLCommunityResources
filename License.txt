Upload to this site if you want the resources you uploaded to be:

1) Used and maintained by the KeeperRL community to improve KeeperRL.
2) Visible to the public
3) Unique to KeeperRL

Otherwise don't.

There is nothing hard about this:

1) Leave our resources out of other games - it will make both games less unique and worse
2) Use these resources to improve KeeperRL.
3) Upload useful resources you wish to donate to the community.

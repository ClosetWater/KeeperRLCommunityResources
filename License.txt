Upload to this site if you want the resources you uploaded to be:

1) Used and maintained by the KeeperRL community to improve KeeperRL.
2) Visible to the public
3) Unique to KeeperRL

Otherwise don't.

The copyright belongs to the KeeperRL community and will be managed by a representative of the community.
This person is the owner of this repository in git but the ownership may change hands.

There is nothing hard about this:

1) Leave our resources out of other games - it will make both games less unique and worse
2) Use these resources to improve KeeperRL.
3) Upload useful resources you wish to donate to the community.

Please feel free to upload your mods with a different copyright but please ensure you include any special copyright in your mod folder, so it can be respected.

For Example, Softmonster mods are licenced under GPL, to make them easy for Michal to use in the vanilla game, if he chooses to.

Special case: Modded graphics
------------------------------

Dear reader,

In KeeperRL, modding the software is achieved by making sprites and changing the game configuration.

I have put mod tiles and graphics into GitHub only under the Mods sub folder, although in some cases the tiles have a complicated history with licensing (modified stock graphics).

I purchased a license for the stock graphics used originally by KeeperRL in the main game. You get one from here:

https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/

So all the graphics are not necessarily under GNU although I have a right to use and modify them in my works.
The relevant tiles can be downloaded in-game and are not necessarily distributable outside specific conditions but do occasionally form a part of my mods,
which I have the right to publish.

Thanks for your understanding.

Soft Monster

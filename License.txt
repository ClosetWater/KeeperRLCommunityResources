There is nothing hard about this:

1) Leave our resources out of other games - it will make both games less unique and worse

Special case: Modded graphics
------------------------------

Dear reader,

In KeeperRL, modding the software is achieved by making sprites and changing the game configuration.
Here, the configuration files are licensed as seen in the COPYING.txt file in the mod folder.
Any graphics will be licensed as seen in the COPYING_GRAPHICS.txt file in the mod folder.

Assume any graphics are a part of mods and ARE NOT REDISTRIBUTABLE,
because in some cases the tiles have a complicated history with licensing:
(modified stock graphics or used by permission of Electric Succubi).

	DO NOT APPLY ANY GIVEN LICENCE TO THE GRAPHICS IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY EXIST.
	DO NOT SEPERATE THE GRAPHICS FROM THE MODS OR CHANGE THE GRAPHICS WITHOUT PERMISSION.

Contact Electric Succubi (Miki@keeperrl.com) for the right to include and modify his graphics tiles in a mod.

I purchased a license for the stock graphics used originally by KeeperRL (in the main game) and this entitles the licensee
only to use them also in their products, and distribute any free products displaying those graphics.
The royalty free license to distribute products that display the older, original graphics can be obtained here:

https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/

So the graphics are not under GPL, although modders must have a right to use and modify them in their works.
Some of the graphics are original works created by the modding community.
Most of the mods are in github or downloadable in-game and are not my mods.

In general, you only have permission to use the relevant graphics by playing the mods in-game,
which we have the right to publish. Never assume that any graphics owned by Electric Succubi, OryxDesignLab
or any member of the modding community can be redistributed without their permission.

Thanks for your understanding.

Soft Monster

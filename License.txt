Upload to this site if you want the resources you uploaded to be:

1) Used and maintained by the KeeperRL community to improve KeeperRL.
2) Visible to the public
3) Unique to KeeperRL

Otherwise don't.

The copyright belongs to the KeeperRL community and will be managed by a representative of the community.
This person is the owner of this repository in git but the ownership may change hands.

There is nothing hard about this:

1) Leave our resources out of other games - it will make both games less unique and worse
2) Use these resources to improve KeeperRL.
3) Upload useful resources you wish to donate to the community.


Update February 2023.

Please feel free to upload your mods with a different copyright but please ensure you include any special copyright in your mod folder, so it can be respected.

For Example, Softmonster mods are licenced under GPL, to make them easy for Michal to use in the vanilla game, if he chooses to.

Special case: Modded graphics
------------------------------

Dear reader,

In KeeperRL, modding the software is achieved by making sprites and changing the game configuration.
The configuration files are indeed licensed under GPL.

Assume any graphics and tiles I have put into GitHub as a part of mods ARE NOT REDISTRIBUTABLE, because in some cases the tiles have a complicated history with licensing
(modified stock graphics or used by permission of Electric Succubi).

DO NOT APPLY ANY GIVEN LICENCE TO THE GRAPHICS FILES IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY EXIST. DO NOT SEPERATE THE GRAPHICS FROM THE MODS OR CHANGE THE GRAPHICS WITHOUT PERMISSION.

Contact Electric Succubi (Miki@keeperrl.com) for the right to include and modify his graphics tiles in a mod.

I purchased a license for the stock graphics used originally by KeeperRL (in the main game) and this entitles me to use them in my product and distribute my product displaying the graphics. You get a license from here:

https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/

So the graphics are not under GPL although I have a right to use and modify them in my works.
The relevant graphics can be used only in-game as a part of a mod.
which we have the right to publish.

Thanks for your understanding.

Soft Monster
